# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we use a csv data file that contains information about Citi bike usage in New York City. We use Tableau to visualize this data to help determine if Des Moines, Iowa could implement a similar Citi bike transportation service.

## Results

The following images show relevant data visualizations for New York Cityâ€™s Citi bike usage.

As we can see, these bikes are used most during the normal rush hours of traffic. 8am to 9am sees a spike of over 140,000 bikes used in August while 3pm to 7pm are also used very frequently. Therefore, bike maintenance should be performed between 3am to 4am due to lack of usage.

Based on this heatmap, we can see that weekdays have a large spike in usage in the morning around 8am and in the evenings around 5pm or 6pm. Then throughout the day the usage is distributed more evenly on the weekends. This could be due to tourists on the weekends and employees on the weekdays.

Most bikes are used for less than 30 minutes which further cements the idea that these bikes are used for short distances, probably to get to and from work to a public transit stop or for a meal. These bikes do not need to have to be designed to last extended periods of time.

This pie chart shows the gender breakdown of bike usage. As we can see, 65% of users are male and about 25% of users are female. The remainder of user have unknown genders.

Males do not use the bikes for any longer time than females even though they use the bikes far more often.

Both females and males use the bikes during the same hours. Notably, Wednesdays do not have the same high usage in the evenings as the other days.

Importantly, subscribers use the bikes far more often than customers. This is important to know that the same people are using this service and therefore rewards programs can lead to more subscribers and customer satisfaction.

## Summary

For this program to be successful in Des Moines, Iowa, there must be a substantial amount of foot traffic in the city where most people can reach their destinations within 30 minutes of using a bike. Then, there would have to be an incentive to subscribe to the service as well. 

### Recommendations

To further decide whether to start this business in Iowa, a visualization about foot traffic in downtown Des Moines would be helpful to determine if these bikes would be successful in that town.

Also, a visualization of data that breaks down the number of bikes used per capita in New York City. This will allow us to determine how many bikes will be needed in Iowa to appease the estimated demand.
